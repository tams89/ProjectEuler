ProjectEuler
============

Solutions to ProjectEuler using a mixture of C# &amp; F# 

I have attempted to use dynamic programming and minimalistic principles to solve each problem. 
Generally I have used the problems as a way to learn F#. In some occasions due to my currently
greater C# knowledge it has proved markedly easier to implement a solution following OO 
principles than functional principles.

In a few cases I have seen optimisations done by others and have added those to my 
solutions so all due to credit to the authors of those solutions where used.
